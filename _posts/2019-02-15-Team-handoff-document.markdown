I've recently had to handoff the teams I've been managing for the last 2 years. Don't worry, I was promoted and started to run a new department which doesn't include those teams. When I started to think of the knowledge transfer to be made, I realized that there were tons of things I needed to transmit and that I would probably forget lots of these if I didn't take some notes while popping up. I also noticed that there were some pieces of knowledge that are actually more aligned with the vision I had for the future of those teams, and of course, I wanted to share that as well. So, I decided to collect the topics for 1 week and then write a handoff document for each team. It wasn't my intention to skip the human interaction involved with the knowledge transfer but to have a more organized way to go through it. Plus, after doing it, the discussions were going to be documented.

Once I finished, I decided to write this article, since I thought I had a great idea. But before start writing it, I googled a bit to check if other managers had done something similar. Lesson learned: Always google. A bit = 2 minutes. I ran into this Lara hogan's post which will ever be better written and hence, more enjoyable to read than mine. I found that several ideas I thought were mine, had exactly the same name on her post ("handoff", "1:1:1", etc). However, since my process was different, I decided to write this anyway. And of course, since I was already a follower of her blog, I would need to think if I hadn't read about it in the past, then forgot, and then remember it in the shape of "new ideas".

The process (recipe):
Recap topics to be transmitted. Take 1 week to just make notes.
Write the handoff document.
Send it to the new manager (write a proper introduction to declare the purpose of the document being shared).
Wait for a confirmation of reading.
Have the first meeting to go through the document. Let the new manager ask questions so the process is more focused on her information needs than your wishes to share something you consider important.
Detect which topics require a specific meeting and if more people should be involved.
Run the meetings.
Stay 1 sprint (we are kind of doing scrum) to show the process and the dynamic. Let the new manager drive.
Redefine the next and last 1:1 with your team members to become 1:1:1 (new manager, team member, and you): Make a proper introduction, but let them interact. Jump in to clarify. The idea is to have you 3 in the same room at least once so there are no doubts regarding what has been said. It's also great to assure continuity on some topics such as career path, ongoing projects, etc.
Fade out until you are invisible. That's how you know that the team you worked so hard to build is safe in informed hands.

The document
Here is a template describing the sections I included and a description of each one. You might need to tweak or even create a new one from the scratch, depending on your context's particular needs.

Workflows Manager Handbook

Description
Provide a quick description of the document, the goals, and intentions. Feel free to include your motivation (even if that means to add a link to this post)

Disclaimer
The new manager probably knows how to do his job. It is important to clarify that it's not your intention to teach, train, or mentor but to give knowledge regarding a specific context. Mine was like this: "This document aims to transfer knowledge in a context, which means, describe the state of the art of different aspects of the team. You will find personal opinions regarding management and the result of building a team answering a punctual management style. By all means, it is not my intention to impose that management style to you. You will see by yourself and probably detect improvement opportunities or simply things you would like to do differently. The description of the current scenario should help you to mind the gap and analyze how those changes could impact so you can make an informed decision.
Additionally, I am intending to be as concise as possible so we can use this document during the hand-off period. That means this document is not a substitute for the Knowledge Transfer and Handover processes but a guide to organizing it."

The Team
Dynamic

Explain the logic of the team. How they are working? what are they used to do? What are their core values? Are they autonomous and self-governed? How do they handle communications? Think of splitting the topics into subsections.
Individuals
Take some time to write about each team member. Take into account that, even this document should be confidential, leaks happen. Don't put information that should be only transmitted during a meeting. I repeated this structure for each team member:
Person (Role)
Context
What is she doing in the team? Is she taking more responsibilities than the job description ones? How did she get here? Tell the story.   
Action Items
Describe the action items that came up from the last performance review (or any other milestone). Continuity is also about following these up.
Strengths and Weaknesses
It's important for the new manager to understand which areas she should give more space, and which ones she should pay more attention.

The Process
Describe how the team organizes its work. Is it divided into iterations? Which ones? Years, Quarters, Sprints? What is the source of requirements (backlog)? Which methodology is being used? How does the team plan? Who estimates? How is the team capacity being calculated? Do you have recurrent meetings? Do these meetings have a particular structure? Which metrics are being taken? How are these being analyzed?
On-going projects
Describe the big assignments the team is already working on. What is the state of each project? Is there a story behind that worth telling? Is there any documentation to read? Who is working with each project?
Vision
Share what had you planned with the team. Include stakeholders to consider if you have already spoken about it with them if it's just an idea or something that has been explored.


Conclusion

I've applied this process and document to 2 teams. It took some time to put all the information together but it's worth it. At the end of the process, it saved more time. We didn't miss anything important, and important topics are now documented. Furthermore, it's good to invest a bit more time to make this transition as smooth as possible. It's good for the new manager, for you and for the entire team.
